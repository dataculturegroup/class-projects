Finding a place in faith within the LGBTQ+ community has long been a battle, but religious communities like The Crossing work to provide a space for open expression in the context of religion. With an emphasis on inclusivity and challenging religious norms, it is a community where anyone is welcome to be themselves.

“...someone told me about The Crossing and I ended up going, and really, I really found it to be this space where I could be, like, queer and Christian,” said Kevin Vetiac, the music director at  The Crossing. <span class="soundcite" data-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/files/JRNL.3610.F21/Transition to the Crossing.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="38000" data-plays="1"> </span>

The Crossing is a Boston-based church founded 15 years ago focused on creating a safe space for members of the LGBTQ+ community to connect with their faith and other members of the community. Vetaic joined the community 11 years ago after looking for a place where they could openly express their identity while also staying connected to faith.

“Joining The Crossing was like a huge part of this process for me to accept myself as queer...” said Vetiac.

During worship ceremonies, the Church allows for time for open discussion about challenges within the religion. They also have meditative time that allows for members to reflect on their experiences in worship evaluating traditional readings in the context of their community.

The Crossing also runs a reflections program that is open to all members of the community. It allows for members to be vulnerable and openly share their experiences. It is not only a way for people to connect with each other but also a chance to see how religion has shaped their perceptions of different aspects of their lives.

According to a study from the [UCLA Williams Institute](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbt-religiosity-us/), there are approximately 5.3 million adults in the LGBTQ+ community that identify as religious, most of whom belong to congregations of the Christian denomination.

Across multiple denominations within the Christian and Catholic churches, members of the LGBTQ+ community grapple with trying to find their place. A [Pew Research Center study](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/06/13/a-survey-of-lgbt-americans/#religion) found that 79% of respondents feel that the Catholic Church is generally unfriendly towards the LGBTQ+ community.

In contrast, The Crossing’s mission statement states, “We affirm and support all identities that are cultivated with and for love.” In creating an inclusive environment, the congregation allows for an open space for all interested in exploring religion in the context of their gender or sexual identity.

The Crossing works to open the Christian community to members of the LGBTQ+ community who want to explore their faith without fear of retribution from other religious institutions. Vetiac explained how  <span class="soundcite" data-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/files/JRNL.3610.F21/Scare Tactic.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="101000" data-plays="1">other institutions</span> had failed them in the past.

After Vetiac joined The Crossing from the Evangelical Church they said, “Because of the rigidity of their theologies there is very little room for any kinds of questions, any kinds of doubts, any kind of disagreement.”

“I just felt at a certain point, like, I outgrew that kind of faith, right, and sort of realized, like, oh my gosh, the world is not black and white” they continued. Vetiac said that their experience in the church was based on a harmful rigidity that presented a God to be feared rather than loved. They also employed the use of fear tactics to keep people in line. They didn’t allow people to question or doubt religion, which Vetiac believes is crucial to growing and maturing in faith.

As a member of The Crossing community Vetiac has had the opportunity to surround themself with a vast and diverse group of supportive individuals. Vetiac shared their <span class="soundcite" data-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/files/JRNL.3610.F21/Moved to Tears.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="88000" data-plays="1">intimate moments </span> with The Crossing.

In the moments they describe they were able to not only connect their faith with their identity but were also able to help others in the community with their unique experiences at The Crossing.

“At some point, I decided The Crossing was going to be my only church,” Vetiac said, “That I did not want to have this experience where it’s like--okay, when I’m in my evangelical church, I can be Christian but I can’t be queer. So, when I was at The Crossing, it felt like it was this space where I could feel whole--where I could bring both my sexuality and my spirituality together in the same place. I did not have to hide one or the other, and I just feel like this is how I want to feel all the time.” <span class="soundcite" data-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/static/files/JRNL.3610.F21/Feel Whole 2.mp3" data-start="0" data-end="37000" data-plays="1"></span>

The Crossing creates a strong sense of community. In addition to doing Holy Communion in a circle at each service, The Crossing has a variety of unique traditions. Vetiac described a special ritual for transgender people who recently received gender confirmation surgery. They acknowledged how special this was. “We realize this is a momentous occasion and people want to have the support of the community with that. And I love that, ‘cause I just haven’t seen that in other places,” Vetiac said.

The Crossing also has a Rite of Leave Taking for those whose time there has come to an end. During the Rite of Leave Taking, community members lay hands on the individual that is leaving. They bless the person and pray, offering well wishes. Vetiac says it allows people to feel like they’re taking a piece of The Crossing with them.

Many of The Crossing’s members are only there temporarily. It’s common for members to be graduate students or people working temporary internships in Boston.

 “The Crossing is such a good space to process transition,” Vetiac said. They believe that The Crossing is perfect for students, because at this point in their lives, many young people are questioning their spirituality for the first time. The Crossing encourages people to explore by providing a safe space free from judgment.

The Crossing is a microcosm of a greater movement toward LGBTQ+ inclusive faith. A [2014 survey from the Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/26/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-americans-differ-from-general-public-in-their-religious-affiliations/) showed that 59% of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults in the U.S. are religiously affiliated — 48% being Christian and 11% identifying with other faiths.

Acceptance of LGBTQ+ people in religious communities is changing as well. Another [2014 Pew Research study](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/views-about-homosexuality/) revealed that 70% of Catholics believed that homosexuality should be accepted. This number increased to 76% in 2019, according to another [Pew Research Center study](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/11/02/how-catholics-around-the-world-see-same-sex-marriage-homosexuality/).

However, issues still persist. A [2017 Pew Research study](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/11/27/views-of-transgender-issues-divide-along-religious-lines/) revealed that 39% of Christians said society has gone too far in terms of accepting transgender people. It also showed that 63% of Christians believe that a person’s gender is determined by their sex at birth.

These statistics show the need for churches like The Crossing. Other communities around Massachusetts and the United States are becoming more affirming of LGBTQ+ individuals. Old South Methodist church in Reading, MA is one of over a thousand churches in the Reconciling Ministries Network, which works to mobilize United Methodists to resist oppression and injustice in faith communities and beyond.

Old South Methodist Church and a church called The Sanctuary Boston have both incorporated elements of The Crossing’s services into their own, such as “open space.” Open space is a break in the service where members can incorporate different activities, such as drawing or meditating, into their worship.

The Crossing holds worship ceremonies that are open to everyone every Thursday evening at 7 p.m. in person at The Cathedral Church of Saint Paul on Tremont Street in Boston or via [Zoom](https://www.thecrossingboston.org/).  With an expanding congregation of approximately 20 to 30 weekly attendees, The Crossing community hopes to attract more members to contribute to the diversity and inclusivity of the group.

“I think for anyone who's curious about The Crossing, they should--they should just come check it out, right,” said Vetaic. “ I really--I really feel like if there's any kind of curiosity, like, just come. And I feel like for the different people have come across as like, even The Crossing ends up not being for you like everyone like walks away with something ... with a piece of The Crossing”
